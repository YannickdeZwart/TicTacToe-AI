# TicTacToe-AI

This project was inspired by a creator called Code Bullet, this creator makes a lot of cool things with the use of algoritms and AI. I thought of creating a simple alogritm to let a computer decide what move was best in a TicTacToe game. i made this system with an MiniMax function, this means it looks at the moves ahead and gives these a score depending of how good the move is. the AI will then play the move with the highest score. I learned a lot from this project and this was really fun.
